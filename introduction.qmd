## Welcome to the workshop!

-   **Time**: 5 days, 1pm - 5pm
-   **Plan**: Work through materials *interactively*
-   We introduce and explain concepts
-   You have a chance to *experiment* with the material
-   **We help out** where necessary

. . .

**Goal**: You know where to start when you want to analyze your own data!

## Who are we?

- We are Lukas and Luca
  (We are not trying to confuse you)


- PhD students at BIPS 
  (*Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS*, Bremen, Germany)
- Research areas: Machine learning, causal inference, general (bio)statistics


## What are R and RStudio?

-   **R** is a programming language used either
    -   *interactively* in a **console**, like a calculator
    -   or non-interactively by executing *scripts* 

-   **RStudio** is a popular *integrated development environment* (IDE) for R
    -   If R is a *horse*, RStudio is a *saddle*
    -   You can use R "alone", but it's much more comfortable with RStudio!

## Why is R Userful?

-   Powerful **statistical analysis** tools
-   Publication-ready **data visualization**
-   Huge **open-source ecosystem** with an active and supportive community
-   Can be used as glorified calculator or for cutting edge statistics

## Also: Nice plots

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

gapminder |>
  dplyr::filter(continent != "Oceania") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country, color = country)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(continent)) +
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = country_colors) +
  labs(
    title = "Life Expectancy 1952 â€“ 2007",
    subtitle = "Data via Gapminder",
    x = "Year", y = "Life Expectancy (years)",
    caption = "Not pictured: Oceania"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

## Including statistics

```{r ggbetween}
trial |>
  ggbetweenstats(
    x = trt, y = marker, 
    xlab = "Treatment", ylab = "Marker Level (Ng/mL)", 
    title = "Tumor Marker in Chemotherapy Treatment",
    bf.message = FALSE,
    caption = "Simulated data"
  )

```

## Or Tables

```{r}
trial |>
  tbl_summary(
    by = trt,
    statistic = list(
      all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})",
      all_categorical() ~ "{n} / {N} ({p}%)"
    ),
    digits = all_continuous() ~ 2,
    label = grade ~ "Tumor Grade",
    missing_text = "(Missing)"
  )
```

## And Tables with Statistics

```{r}
trial |>
  tbl_cross(
    row = stage,
    col = trt,
    percent = "cell", 
    label = list(trt = "Treatment", stage = "Tumor Stage")
  ) |>
  add_p()
```


## Ecosystem

-   R is enhanced through *packages*
-   Third part software written by members of the community
-   Available for free through *CRAN* and other repositories
-   Thousands of packages by professionals, hobbyists, students
-   Popular examples:
    -   `ggplot2` for data visualization
    -   `dplyr`for data manipulation
    -   Part of the `tidyverse` family of packages
-   We will install some of these for the course!

## Outlook

![The workflow model according to "R for Data Science (2e), Wickham et al."](assets/img/r4ds-model.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"}

. . .

Here we focus on **the basics**

## Managing Expectations

R is a programming *language*, so keep in mind that

-   learning a language takes time!
-   you will need to memorize vocabulary
-   getting used to grammar can be frustrating
-   lots of practice is needed to become fluent

. . .

**But also**: It feels great to make progress!

## Orientation: RStudio

![](assets/img/rstudio-example.png)

## Stay Organized

Some recommendations to keep organized:

-   Every project has it's own dedicated directory
-   Projects are not nested
-   RStudio keeps a project file in the projects *root* directory: `course_introduction_to_r.Rproj`
-   Double-click this file to open the project in RStudio once you have the materials

## Ready to Go?

::: nonincremental
You should have R and RStudio installed and **RStudio** open and working

If not:

-   Installation instructions: <https://lukasburk.de/posts/install-r>
-   If all fails use RStudio in the browser via <https://posit.cloud> (needs registration but can be used for free)
