## Welcome to the workshop!

-   **Time**: 5 days, 1pm - 5pm
-   **Plan**: Work through materials *interactively*
-   We introduce and explain concepts
-   You have a chance to *experiment* with the material
-   **We help out** where necessary

. . .

**Goal**: You know where to start when you want to analyze your own data!

## What are R and RStudio?

-   **R** is a programming language used either
-   *interactively* in a **console**,
-   or non-interactively by executing *scripts*

. . .

-   **RStudio** is a popular *integrated development environment* (IDE) for R
-   If R is a horse, RStudio is a *saddle*
-   -\> You can use R "alone", but it's much more comfortable with RStudio!

## Why is R Userful?

-   Powerful **statistical analysis** tools
-   Publication-ready **data visualization**
-   Huge **open-source ecosystem**!

. . .

```{r ggbetween}
ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats(gtsummary::trial, x = trt, y = marker, xlab = "Treatment", ylab = "Tumor Marker (ng/mL)")
```

## Managing Expectations

R is a programmig *language*, so keep in mind that

-   learning a language takes time!
-   you will need to memorize vocabulary
-   getting used to grammar can be frustrating
-   lots of practice is needed to become fluent

. . .

**But also**: It feels great to make progress!

## Orientation: RStudio

## Stay Organized

Some recommendations to keep organized:

-   Every project has it's own dedicated directory
-   Projects are not nested
-   RStudio keeps a project file in the projects *root* directory Here: `course_introduction_to_r.Rproj`
-   Double-click this file to open the project in RStudio

## Ready to Go?

::: nonincremental
You should have R and RStudio installed and **RStudio** open and working

If not:

-   Installation instructions: <https://lukasburk.de/posts/install-r>
-   If all fails use RStudio in the browser via <https://posit.cloud> (needs registration but can be used for free)
