# Introduction to R

Introduction to data management and data analysis with R and RStudio.

## Outline

The course is grouped into (potentially overlapping) sections which do not necessarily need to correspond to workshop days.  
The sections are:

### 1. Getting started  

- Setting up R and RStudio and getting familiar with RStudio as an environment  
- Basic R syntax and common language features such as the included help system  
- Essential data types and data structures  
- Familiarization with example datasets used throughout the course  
- Using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) as the environment for code examples and exercises  

### 2. Exploratory data analysis  

- Creating and manipulating tabular data with the tidyverse  
- Preparing for typical data cleaning tasks  
- Data visualization basics using ggplot2  
- Descriptive statistics to understand one's data 
- Assess data integrity  
- Paving the way for publication-ready tables and visualizations using extension packages  

### 3. Statistical analysis  

- Basic hypothesis testing for common research questions  


## Prerequisites

Ideally R and RStudio are already installed at the start of the course. See [these instructions](https://lukasburk.de/posts/install-r/) for example.

If a local setup is not feasible, consider using an online service such as [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) (see below).
