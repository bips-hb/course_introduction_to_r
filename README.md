# course_introduction_to_r

Introduction to data management and data analysis with R and RStudio.

## Outline

The course is grouped into potentially overlapping sections which do not necessarily need to correspond to workshop days.  
The sections are:

1. Getting started
  - Setting up R and RStudio and getting familiar with RStudio as an environment
  - Basic R syntax and common language features such as the included help system
  - Essential data types and data structures
  - Familiarization with example datasets used throughout the course
  - Using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) as the environment for code examples and exercises
2. Exploratory data analysis
  - Creating and manipulating tabular data with the tidyverse
  - Preparing for typical data cleaning tasks
  - Data visualization basics using ggplot2
  - Descriptive statistics to understand one's data
  - Assess data integrity
  - Paving the way for publication-ready tables and visualizations using extension packages
3. Statistical analysis
  - Basic hypothesis testing for common research questions


## Prerequisites

Ideally R and RStudio are already installed at the start of the course. See [these instructions](https://lukasburk.de/posts/install-r/) for example.

If a local setup is not feasible, consider using an online service such as [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/).
